This is a script created with python to count Bills.

It asks the user to input the amout of bills that they have and it then calculates the total dollar amount.


To run:
	Open up cmd or terminal and type python countbills.py. 
	Note if you are on Mac and have Python 3 installed make sure to use python3 countbills.py instead. 

	There is a current bug if you are not using python3 and you put null for an answer so if you have 0 of a bill please put 0 until fix!
